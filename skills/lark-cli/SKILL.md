# Lark CLI

`lark-cli` carries its own agent documentation, compiled into the binary and versioned
with it. Read it from the CLI; do not work from memory and do not look for docs in this
repo.

## Routing

```bash
lark-cli --help                      # the 23 domains, one line each
lark-cli <domain> --help             # +shortcuts (prefer these) and raw API resources
lark-cli skills read lark-<domain>   # the domain guide: concepts, workflows, gotchas
lark-cli skills read lark-<domain> references/<file>.md   # deeper references
lark-cli schema <service>.<resource>.<method>             # params, types, scopes
```

Start with `lark-cli --help` to pick the domain, then read that domain's guide before
the first call. `lark-cli api <METHOD> <path>` is the escape hatch when no typed command
exists.

Read `lark-cli skills read lark-shared` first for auth, `--as user` vs `--as bot`, and
permission-denied handling. Identity does not carry across commands: pass `--as`
explicitly on every call in a workflow.

## Rules

Every command's `--help` labels it `read`, `write`, or `high-risk-write`.
**`high-risk-write` requires `--yes`, and only after the user has confirmed.** Use
`--dry-run` to preview a request without sending it.

`--jq <expr>` filters JSON output. Suppress the `_notice` banner that otherwise pollutes
every JSON response:

```bash
LARKSUITE_CLI_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1 LARKSUITE_CLI_NO_SKILLS_NOTIFIER=1 lark-cli ...
```
